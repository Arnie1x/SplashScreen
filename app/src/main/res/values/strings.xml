    <string name="dummy_text_1">A Fragment represents a reusable portion of your app\'s UI. A fragment
        defines and manages its own layout, has its own lifecycle, and can handle its own input
        events. Fragments can't live on their own. </string>

    <string name="dummy_text_3">A HorizontalScrollView is a layout container for a view hierarchy that can be scrolled by the
        user, allowing it to be larger than the physical display. A HorizontalScrollView is a
        FrameLayout, meaning you should place one child in it containing the entire contents to
        scroll; this child may itself be a layout manager with a complex hierarchy of objects.
        A child that is often used is a LinearLayout in a horizontal orientation, presenting a
        horizontal array of top-level items that the user can scroll through.</string>
